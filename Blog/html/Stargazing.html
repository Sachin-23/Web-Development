                    <p>Zero pollution is the remarkable and unbeatable character of the night sky found when you are visiting Nubra Valley in Ladakh. Peace is the synonym you can confer on to Nubra especially when the moon is up above the sky playing games with its friends and family consisting of trillions of stars cluttered in circles, rectangle and in unknown shapes. </p>
                    <p>A camper would definitely choose to have his tents opened and gaze at the sky throughout the night. A predominant stargazing destination in India is Nubra Valley which showers plenty of opportunities for a peaceful camping amidst flabbergasting serenity.</p>

                    <p>In an attempt to catch the Geminid Meteor Shower in 2016, I landed up in the Little Rann of Kutch, fingers crossed for clear and dark skies, devoid of light or air pollution. Unlike the Great Rann of Kutch with the white salt desert, the Little Rann sees few visitors, and I was glad to be one of the only people staying in a kooba (round thatched roof hut) opposite the cracked earth desert. When night fell, I lay in absolute darkness and silence, my eyes slowly adjusting to the night sky. Bright stars appeared above me one by one, shooting stars dashed through the sky and big green mesmerising Geminid meteors stole the show</p>

                    <p>The Andaman & Nicobar Islands offer much more than dreamy beaches; thanks to their remote location and little light pollution, the night skies are stupendous for both stargazing and creating astro time-lapse videos. Lay on the unobstructed helipad on Havelock Island, on a tropical night, for thousands of stars in your eyes and the waves of the Indian Ocean in your ears. Or go further off the beaten track to Mayabunder, to live with a tribal Karen family, so far away from  city lights that as the sky above fills with twinkling stars, you’d begin to wonder if the former really exist.</p>

                  <p>Living without electricity in different parts of Garhwal totally made me question why we need it at all. Days are meant to be spent outdoors and nights under dark shimmering skies. As I lay under thousands of stars, I couldn’t help but think back to my childhood days in Dehradun, when during long powercuts at night, we would sleep out in the garden, in the breeze and under the stars! These days, nights in most Indian households are for television, internet and air conditioning. Perhaps it’s time to reconsider what “development” really is.</p>
