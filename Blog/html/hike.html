          <p>Hiking in India: 10 Trails with the Most Scenic Views</p>

            <span class = "h">Stok Kangri Summit or Markha Valley, Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir</span>
                  <div class="info_">

                  <div class="">
                    <p>Many long and short trekking trails start from Leh-Ladakh district. The Stok Kangri trek is the most challenging of these trails in Ladakh, but, definitely the best of all. Stok Kangri, at 6,153 metres, is the highest trekking point of India, which is almost 70% of Mount Everest. Though not an easy thing to achieve, this trek, from every corner is glamorous and awesome. The most challenging part of this trek is the thin air. Most people return from the base camp without   even attempting to climb the peak.</p>
                    <p>At least 3-4 days of acclimatisation is recommended, and a very good fitness and prior experience in high altitude treks are a must. The route takes you via the Stok Village, which in itself is very beautiful. The clear views of Ladakh Range, Zanskar Range, Indus-Markha Valley and the city of Leh are a feast for the eyes.</p>
                    <p>The best time to visit is either at dawn or dusk when the atmosphere is brilliantly altered by the change in lighting. If possible, try to catch a view of the Taj Mahal's reflection from the far bank of the Yamuna River-it makes for a memorable (and safe) selfie.</p>
                    <p>The period from July to September is the best season to attempt this trek, and the duration varies from 9 days to 10 days. You will cover an approximate distance of about 40 kilometres in this stunning Stok Kangri Trek, and hikers from all over the world come to this place to experience the beauty of nature, so abundantly available all throughout the trekking trail.</p>

              <span class="h"> Zanskar Frozen River, Ladakh</span>

                  <div class="">
                    <p>The Zanskar frozen river trek is one of the most challenging treks in this region. During summer, Zanskar River is a swift flowing river, but during the winter months, the river freezes down. It serves as the only passage to the main valley, as heavy snowfall cuts off the entire region from the rest of the world. Thousands of trekkers take part in the trekking expedition during this time to experience the beautiful frozen river, whirling through deep passages with snow-clad peaks all around. </p>
                    <p>Popularly known as ‘Chadar Trek’ due to the formation of a thick blanket of ice on the Zanskar River, this trek is very difficult to complete. It is tricky at times when snow thickets drift away from beneath the feet and the only way to complete the route during such a situation is to climb through the snowy rocks and boulders beside the river.</p>
                    <p>This trek is one of the most challenging treks and takes around 8-9 days to cover a total distance of about 105 kilometres. The temperature during the night reaches at around -25 to -35 degrees, which also makes this trek very inhospitable for humans. Experienced guides and proper trekking kit along with good physical fitness and experience in high altitude trekking, are a must before attempting this trek.</p>
